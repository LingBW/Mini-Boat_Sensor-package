RaspberryPi with air station
RaspberryPi read the temperature sensor data and send the data to satellite transmatter.We may get three defferent type of data: One is '000000000000000000', which means both sensors is down. Two is '000000000' shows in the start or end of the message. Three is normal data we need.
