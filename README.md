# Sensor_package on mini_boat

RaspberryPi read the temperature sensor data and send the data to satellite transmatter.We may get three defferent type of data: One is '000000000000000000', which means both sensors is down; Two is '000000000' shows in the start or end of the message; Three is normal data we need.

We put the sensor package on one mini_boat named RockStar.Jim and I did a lot work to finish it.<img src="./Pictures/IMG_2987.JPG" alt="RockStar View" > We left RockStar at the Jim's house backyard since August, 2016. I compared RockStar data with DataCarrison System--Temperature sensor at Waquoit Bay,Falmouth.<img src="./Pictures/RockStar_DataCarrison.png" alt="RockStar View" >

There are two temperature sensor on RockStar. One is on the top of pole. Another one is at the bottom of tail. Comparison of two sensors.<img src="./Pictures/top_bottom.png" alt="RockStar View" >
