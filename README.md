# Sensor_package on mini_boat

RaspberryPi read the temperature sensor data and send the data to satellite transmatter.We may get three defferent type of data: One is '000000000000000000', which means both sensors is down; Two is '000000000' shows in the start or end of the message; Three is normal data we need.

We put the sensor package on one mini_boat named RockStar.Jim and I did a lot work to finish it.<img src="./Pictures/IMG_2987.JPG" alt="RockStar View" > We left RockStar at the Jim's house backyard since August, 2016.
